# Converter
Converters handle converting the limited YAML structures into complex Python types.

## Making your own
A converter can either be a function or a subclass of [`Converter`][api-converter].
If you want to use your converter for a [Slave] you're either gonna have to annotate
the argument with the converter, or register it using the [`converter`][api-converter]
decorator which needs to be given the type your converter converts to.
